# INTRODUCTION
Hello! In this README, we will explain how to create a shell using the C programming language. We will break down the steps in a simple manner for reference in the future. It will include the steps to create a simple shell.

# STEPS TO CREATE A SHELL

### Step 1: Including the Necessary Libraries
Step 1: Including the Necessary Libraries
To create a shell, we need to include certain libraries in our program. These libraries provide functions that help us work with the operating system. In the provided file, you can see several #include statements that include libraries like <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <unistd.h>. These libraries provide functions for input/output, memory management, and system calls respectively.

### Step 2: Defining Constants and Structures
In the provided file, you will find some lines that start with #define. These lines define constants that are used throughout the shell program. These constants help in setting the size of buffers, specifying command chaining types, and managing environment variables.

You will also see some structure definitions like list_t and info_t. These structures help in organizing and storing data in a structured manner.

### Step 3: Implementing Shell Functions
The provided file contains several functions that are used in the shell program. These functions handle different tasks such as parsing user input, executing commands, handling errors, managing environment variables, and more. Each function has a specific purpose and contributes to the overall functionality of the shell.

### Step 4: Creating the Main Loop
The main loop of the shell program is responsible for repeatedly accepting user input, parsing it, and executing the corresponding commands. In the provided file, the main loop is implemented in the loophsh function. It calls other functions to perform tasks like reading input, finding built-in commands, finding external commands, forking processes to execute commands, and handling errors.

### Step 5: Building and Running the Shell
To build and run the shell, you need to compile the source code using a C compiler. You can use a command-line tool like gcc to compile the code into an executable file. Once the executable is created, you can run it from the command line. The shell will start, and you can begin typing commands and interacting with the computer.

### CONCLUSION
That is the general outline. May be missing a couple of stuff.
